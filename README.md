# My First Neural Network!

A neural network implemented from scratch for learning purposes. The implementation is based on [3blue1brown's neural networks series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) and my intuition + experimentation.

Uses the MNIST dataset.
